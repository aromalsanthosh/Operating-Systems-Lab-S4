/*First in, first out (FIFO), also known as first come, first served (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
 FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue.
 In this, the process that comes first will be executed first and next process starts only after the previous gets fully executed.*/
